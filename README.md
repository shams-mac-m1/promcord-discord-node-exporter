# promcord

## What is promcord?

Promcord is a Discord bot which provides metrics from a Discord server to create insight and alerting on actions and messages. Using [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) you can easily visualize all your metrics in beautiful dashboards.

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
Easiest way of reaching me is via [Discord](https://c0debase.de/).

## Getting Started

This section provides a high-level requirement & quick start guide. **For detailed installations, such as getting started with Maven, Docker, or Grafana, please check out their docs.**


### Prerequisites

- [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) 
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)
- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)

#### Docker Installation (local install)

1. Follow the [Docker CE install guide](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and the [Docker Compose install guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/), which illustrates multiple installation options for each OS.
2. Set up your environment variables/secrets in `.env` file
```
DISCORD_TOKEN=<your token>
```
3. Download the [prometheus.yml](prometheus.yml) file to your current directory.
4. Run the Docker App with `docker-compose up -d`
5. Navigate to http://localhost:80 to access Grafana. Follow [this](https://grafana.com/docs/guides/getting_started/) guide to configure your Grafana server. You will need to add Prometheus as your datasource. For the Prometheus datasource settings, use `http://localhost:9090` as the URL and `Browser` as the Access.
6. That's it! To simplify the creation of Grafana Dashboards, you can download a ready-made dashboard [here](grafana.json) to [import it into Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/reference/export_import/)

#### Docker Installation (production install)

1. Follow the [Docker CE install guide](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and the [Docker Compose install guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/), which illustrates multiple installation options for each OS.
2. Set up your environment variables/secrets in `.env` file
```
DISCORD_TOKEN=<your token>
```
3. Download the [prometheus.yml](prometheus.yml) file to your current directory.
4. Rename docker-compose.yml.sample to docker-compose.yml (The .sample compose file will contain links in order for Grafana and Prometheus to talk to each other)
5. Run the Docker App with `docker-compose up -d`
6. Navigate to http://ip_address:80 to access Grafana. Follow [this](https://grafana.com/docs/guides/getting_started/) guide to configure your Grafana server - you will need to add Prometheus as your datasource. For the Prometheus datasource settings, use `http://prometheus:9090` as the URL and `Server` as the Access.
7. That's it! To simplify the creation of Grafana Dashboards, you can download a ready-made dashboard [here](grafana.json) to [import it into Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/reference/export_import/)
8. It is recommended you use Nginx and [reverse proxy](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/reverse-proxy/) to the Grafana instance for production use. Simply change docker-compose.yml Grafana ports from `80:3000` to `3000:3000`, then reverse proxy to http://localhost:3000 in the Nginx configuration. 

### Developer Installation

1. Make sure all the prerequisites are installed.
2. Fork promcord repository, ie. https://github.com/Biospheere/promcord/fork
3. Clone your forked repository, ie. `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/promcord.git`
4. Set up your environment variables/secrets
```
DISCORD_TOKEN=<your token>
```
5. Use [prometheus.yml](prometheus.yml) for Prometheus (Edit target hostname!)
6. That's it! Go to [http://your-ip:grafana-port](http://localhost:3000) to access Grafana. Then follow [this](https://grafana.com/docs/guides/getting_started/) guide to configure your Grafana server. 
7. To simplify the creation of Grafana Dashboards, you can download a ready-made dashboard [here](grafana.json) to [import it into Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/reference/export_import/)
